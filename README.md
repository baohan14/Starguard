## 🔍 How It Works

**Starguard** employs a series of algorithms and heuristics to evaluate the health of a repository. Here’s a brief overview of its processes:

1. **Data Collection**: The tool gathers data from the GitHub API, including star counts, commit history, and dependency information.
2. **Analysis**: Using predefined criteria, **Starguard** analyzes the data to identify anomalies. For instance, a sudden spike in stars might indicate a fake-star campaign.
3. **Reporting**: After the analysis, **Starguard** generates a report that highlights any risks and provides recommendations for further action.
